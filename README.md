The objective of this project is to describe the implementation of a searchable database and analyze the relationship between variant emergence and vaccination rollout. The report outlines the dataset sources, and methodology, and provides an analysis of the trends observed.

Dataset: For variant data, the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) dataset from the website https://gisaid.org/ was utilized to determine the emergence of different variants. The dataset was transformed and categorized based on specific variants and countries. A total of 217 countries' data was included in the analysis. For vaccination data, the "Our World in Data" dataset from the website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations was used to understand the number of cases per country within a given timeframe.
